# 🧠 Deep Learning Lab Record

This repository is my personal **Deep Learning Lab Record**, representing my learning journey in the field of deep learning and neural networks.  
It contains hands-on experiments, practice notebooks, and implementations of key concepts such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), autoencoders, loss functions, optimizers, and training pipelines.  
The goal of this repo is to track my progress, document what I learn, and build a strong foundation through continuous experimentation.  
Consider this repository as my **learning log, lab work, and experimentation space** while exploring deep learning 🚀
